## Taste <span class="badge">4.5 / 5</span>

Nice texture that stays soft even at freezing temperature. Good taste of chocolate and mint. Hardly noticeable taste of whey

## Nutrition analysis <span class="badge">4 / 5</span>

**Pros:** High content of fiber (7g/bar), low simple sugars (5g/bar) and high content in protein (14g/bar) which helps with satiety. It makes it a good snack for low to moderate intensity activities. Whey comes from grass-fed cows and fish oil from responsibly-caught fish.  Unable to get the exact amount of omega-3s
 
**Cons:** Ingredient list is long and filled with ingredients you wonâ€™t find in your pantry!

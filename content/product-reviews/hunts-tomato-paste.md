## Taste <span class="badge">5 / 5</span>

Tomato pasta in purée. No added herbs or seasoning. It is very versatile and can be used in a lot of recipes on the trail: pasta sauce, mexican rice, chili, stews and soups.

## Nutrition analysis <span class="badge">4.5 / 5</span>

**Pros:** Low in sodium (25mg/ pouch) and high in potassium (420 mg/pouch). It looks like there is no added sugar (according to the ingredient list). High fiber content (3g/pouch). 
 
**Cons:** Only 2 ingredients on the list: tomato paste and citric acid. This last one is a common food preservative. However, it exists other tomato-based products that don’t include this preservative. 

## Convenience <span class="badge">5 / 5</span>
Individual plastic pouches allow you to only bring the required quantity on the trail and not have to carry leftovers. It is lightweight and easy to pack out!

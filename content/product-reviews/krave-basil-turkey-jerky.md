## Taste <span class="badge">4 / 5</span>

Subtle flavours of basil. This is an interesting change compared to the more traditional seasonings of jerky. Could be more “citrusy”. Texture is relatively soft and moist for a jerky.

## Nutrition analysis <span class="badge">4 / 5</span>

**Pros:** no nitrites, ingredients list is relatively short and composed of terms we know. Very low in fat. High in protein for high satiety level.
 
**Cons:** As much carbohydrate than protein for a turkey-based snack! If you eat the whole package (very likely!), you get a large quantity of sodium (1470mg).

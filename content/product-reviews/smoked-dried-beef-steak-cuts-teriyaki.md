## Taste <span class="badge">3.5 / 5</span>

The thick pieces change from the usual thin sliced jerky. Texture is soft. Taste does not offer anything out of the ordinary: sweet soy sauce...

## Nutrition analysis <span class="badge">4 / 5</span>

**Pros:** Ingredientsâ€™ list is short and very easy to understand. More protein than carbohydrates, which is what we are looking for in a jerky!
 
**Cons:** Sodium (450 mg/oz) is pretty high.

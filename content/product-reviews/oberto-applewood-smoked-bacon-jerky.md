## Taste <span class="badge">4.5 / 5</span>

Authentic taste of bacon with a nice applewood smoke twist to it. Although the jerky is pretty dry, it is not too tough to eat. This jerky is good to eat on its own but could also be a good addition to dishes cooked on the trail such as egg scrambles or alfredo pasta.

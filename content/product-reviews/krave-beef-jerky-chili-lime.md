## Taste <span class="badge">3 / 5</span>

Subtle notes of lime for the first bite but for the following bites, it seems like the spicyness is the only thing noticeable. Texture is ok.

## Nutrition analysis <span class="badge">3.5 / 5</span>

**Pros:** Low in fat (1.5g/oz). Sodium (380mg/oz) is lower than in other jerkys. Ingredient list relatively easy to understand.
 
**Cons:** more carbohydrates than protein in a meat-based product!

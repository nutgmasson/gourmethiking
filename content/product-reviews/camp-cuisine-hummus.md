## Taste <span class="badge">3 / 5</span>

Bland when eaten on its own. Add sundried tomatoes, olives, dried herbs or spices to add flavor.

## Nutrition analysis <span class="badge">4.5 / 5</span>

**Pros:**  Relatively simple list of ingredients. Half of a package provides 8g of fiber and 16g of protein, which makes a good foundation for a satisfying meal on the trail.
 
**Cons:** With 100 mg of sodium by 2 tbsp of prepared hummus, the amount of sodium can easily reach high levels. However, if you are sweating a lot, it is exactly what you need!

## Convenience <span class="badge">3.5 / 5</span>

This product requires that you add water and olive oil to the dried powder. Although mixing this preparation in the product's pouch is possible, it is hard to get an homogeneous product.

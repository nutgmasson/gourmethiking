## Taste <span class="badge">2.5 / 5</span>

Nothing exceptional here. The taste reminded me of hot-dogs… Inside texture is soft, the outside layer being a little rough.

## Nutrition analysis <span class="badge">2 / 5</span>

**Pros:** not much to say here… The first ingredients are beef and pork!
 
**Cons:** Long list of ingredients that required advanced nutrition knowledge to understand. High in sodium (533mg/oz). High in fat (8g/oz) and relatively high in saturated fat (3g/oz). Relatively low in protein (5g/oz) for meat-based product.

## Equipment
- Stove + fuel
- Pot large enough to fit the baking pan
- Baking pan that fits in your cooking pot (I used 6" one.)
- Wooden spoon or tongs to remove manipulate the baking pan.

## Before trip
1. Mix in plastic bag #1 all the ingredients except the ghee
1. Pour ghee in a leakproof container.

## At camp
1. Spread about 1 tbsp of ghee on the baking pan. 
1. Add ⅓ cup (80 ml) of water and the remainder of the ghee to bag #1 and mix well.
1. Pour the mix into the baking pan. 
1. Pour some water in your pot (about 1 cup or 250 ml).
1. Place your baking pan in your cooking pot. 
1. Cook on your stove at low temperature with the lid on. Make sure there is always some liquid in your pot. 
1. When fully baked, remove the muffin from the baking pan and enjoy!

## Tips
You can also place a few rocks in your pot and place your baking pan over the rocks. This will provide a more even baking result.

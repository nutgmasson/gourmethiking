## Equipment
- Stove + fuel
- Pot to boil water
- Lightweight pan
- Wooden spoon to mix
- Bowl to eat
- Sporks or forks!

## Before trip
1. Mix in plastic bag #1: eggs, chives, dried bell peppers, dried spinach, dried basil, salt and pepper.
1. Pour oil in a leakproof bottle.
 
## At camp
1. Bring to boil about 1 cup of water.
1. Pour boiling water in the dehydrated hashbrowns. If you use the “Golden Grill” container, you only need to pour water until you reach the line. If not, just add enough water to rehydrate the potatoes and wait 12 minutes.
1. Mix 1 cup (250 ml) of cold water in bag 1.
1. Put 1 tbsp (15 ml) of oil in the pan.  Scramble the egg and vegetable mix until cooked. Remove from the pan.
1. Add 2 tbsp of oil in the pan. Stir-fry the hashbrowns until lightly crispy and golden. Add the cooked egg and vegetables.
1. Enjoy!

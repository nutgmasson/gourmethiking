These bars will fuel your winter adventures and put a smile on your face after each bite! They stay soft even at freezing temperature, which make them easy to eat during a snowy day. Ok, they are a bit high in fat for a high intensity training but are perfect for these long outings on snowshoes or on backcountry skis.

Sweet and satisfying, these cookies will be the perfect partners for your next hiking or long bike ride. Rich in carbohydrate, they will provide the fuel you need for your next outdoor adventure. Their protein and fiber content will make you fill full until your next stop.

Vincent and I tested these cookies on a climb of Mt. St. Helens, WA. The cookies were even better on the mountain than in my kitchen!
 
Note that I am not a big fan of cinnamon so if you prefer a powerful cinnamon flavor, double the quantity!

A slice of bread that contains 18g of proteins? Yeap, and it tastes delicious!  This bread is moist but dense enough to travel well in a backpack. For those who worry that making bread is complicated, this recipe will prove you the contrary! The fat from the cheese keeps this bread moist for 4 to 5 days if well wrapped.

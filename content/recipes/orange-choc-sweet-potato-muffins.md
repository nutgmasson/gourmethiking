These delicious muffins are a good option for breakfast-on-the-go when driving to the mountains early in the morning. Bring a fruit and a portion of milk or drinkable yogurt for a more complete breakfast! 

Alternatively, these muffins can be a good snack for a low-intensity training. 
 
## Ingredients
- 1 small sweet potato, peeled and cut in medium pieces
- 1 cup (250 ml) all-purpose flour

- ½ cup (125 ml) brown sugar

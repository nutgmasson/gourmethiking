Are your breakfasts always the same and boring? Not anymore with this recipe of chocolate granola. Hey yes, a recipe with chocolate created by a dietitian for breakfast! And in extra, this granola is fortified in protein for long lasting satiety.


Each portion of 3/4 cup contains 9g of protein and is low in fat. Add Greek yogurt or cottage cheese and fruits (I chose frozen raspberry and cherries for this picture) to this granola to make a complete meal.


To be totally honest with you, this granola is not very sweet. If you have a sweet tooth, I suggest you add dried fruit and why not also chocolate chips to the cooled granola!?

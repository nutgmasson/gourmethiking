If you have a garden that produces an impressive quantity of zucchinis and that you don’t know what to do with them at this point, this recipe is for you! 
 
As usual, I tested this recipe in the outdoor. Since it makes a dozen, I brought them on several adventures: from rock climbing to hiking on different trails in Washington State.
 
Sweet and satisfying these muffins make a good snack. Rich in carbohydrate, they will provide the fuel you need for your next outdoor adventure or to stay alert in school.

If you have a garden that produces an impressive quantity of zucchinis and that you don’t know what to do with them at this point, this recipe is for you! 
 
As usual, I tested this recipe in the outdoor. Since it makes a dozen, I brought them on several adventures: from rock climbing to hiking on different trails in Washington State.
 
Sweet and satisfying these muffins make a good snack. Rich in carbohydrate, they will provide the fuel you need for your next outdoor adventure or to stay alert in school. 

## Ingredients

- ½ cup (125 ml) brown sugar
- 1 cup (250 ml) old-fashioned oatmeal
- 1 cup (250 ml) all-purpose flour

- 1 tbsp. (15 ml) lemon zest
- 2 tsp. (10 ml) baking powder
- 1 pinch of salt
- 2 cups (500 ml) zucchini, shredded
- ¾ cup (180 ml) dried blueberries

- 1 tsp. (5 ml) vanilla extract

## Preparation

1. In a large bowl, mix the brown sugar, oatmeal, flour, oats bran, lemon zest, baking powder and salt. 
1. Add the zucchini and the dried blueberries. Make sure it is well mixed. 
1. In a smaller bowl, mix all the liquid ingredients. 
1. Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ones.

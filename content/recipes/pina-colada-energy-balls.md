These sweet energy balls will transport you on a beach with palm trees and white sand! The sugars contained in this snack will provide quick energy to keep you hiking whether you are on the beach or on a snow-covered mountain!

## Ingredients

- ½ cup (125 ml) pitted dates
- ½ cup (125 ml) dried and sweetened pineapples
- ½ cup (125 ml) roasted cashews*
- ½ cup (125 ml) sweetened shredded coconut, divided in 2 equal parts**

\* I used coconut cashews from Trader Joe’s to get extra coconut taste.

** If you want a snack that doesn't taste super sweet, I suggest you use unsweetened coconut.

## Preparation

1. Put aside ¼ cup (60 ml) of shredded coconut. 
1. Combine all the other ingredients in food processor. 
1. Blend until it reaches the desired texture. This can take a few minutes. 
1. Roll into balls and roll in the shredded coconut. 
1. Wrap for your trips! Enjoy! 

## Tips

Keep them in the fridge or even freeze them for better conservation!

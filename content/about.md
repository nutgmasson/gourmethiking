				<p class="lead mb-small">
				The mission of Gourmet Hiking is to translate nutrition science into tasty recipes and resources for hikers and backpackers to help them enjoy their favorite activity.
				</p>
				<p class="lead mb-small">
				<strong>Science to trail as a basis for everything.</strong> All recipes, blog posts and other resources available on Gourmet Hiking are based on sports nutrition and exercise physiology scientific findings.
				</p>
				<p class="lead mb-small">
				<strong>Taste as the main criteria for recipe creation.</strong> Nutrient composition of recipes is analyzed but if a recipe doesnâ€™t pass the test of taste buds on the trail, it is not published.

				<p class="lead mb-small">
				Originally from the province of Quebec in Canada, I grew up in a family in which sports was a religion. Racing in cross-country skiing at a national level taught me a lot, especially about perseverance and hard work. Add to the mix a passion for cooking and a strong interest for science, becoming a sports dietitian was just a natural go-to! I am a <a href="http://www.eatrightpro.org/resources/about-us/what-is-an-rdn-and-dtr/what-is-a-registered-dietitian-nutritionist" style="color:white; text-decoration: underline;">registered dietitian nutritionist</a> licensed in Canada and USA. Now living in Whistler, BC, Canada, I enjoy hiking, backpacking, rock climbing, biking and obviously, trying recipes in the Northwest outdoors!

 				Curiosity, passion and hard work define me</p>
 				</p>
 				<p class="lead mb-small">
				<strong>Curiosity</strong> for new places, meeting new people and trying new recipes! From a trip to an Asian grocery store with exotic produce to a new summit to conquer: everything can be an excuse to discover!
				</p>
				<p class="lead mb-small">
				<strong>Passion</strong> for what I do, for where I come from and for where I am going. Pursuing passions leads to a life without regrets.
				</p>
				<p class="lead mb-small">
				<strong>Hard work</strong> to accomplish what I dream of.

Trader Joe’s grocery store, with its unique products, can be a great source of inspiration for new backpacking recipes. Here are some of recent findings:

		<h2>Freeze dried fruits</h2>
		Freeze dried foods have a lot of advantages compared to dehydrated:
		-They tend to have a flavor more similar to fresh foods
		-They contain more nutrients, thanks to the faster transformation process
		-They rehydrate faster.
		However, freeze dried foods can be expensive. Not at Trader Joe’s! During a recent trip, there were freeze-dried mango, raspberries, strawberries, apple and blueberries. These fruits would be good additions to oatmeal, granola and breakfast cereals. Apples and mangoes can also be used in savory dishes such as curries and couscous.

		<h2>Israeli couscous</h2>
		Can be cooked like rice and included in different dishes. It has a tapioca-like shape but firmer texture.

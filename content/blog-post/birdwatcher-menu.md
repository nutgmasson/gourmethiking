The birdwatcher prefers to describe his/her day by the number of birds or animals observed rather than the km covered. The breaks are frequent (this is how you spot birds right?), so are the opportunities to eat. The exercise intensity is usually low to moderate and given the relatively easy pace, extra weight in the backpack is not a major issue.

### Nutrition Concern:

Given the relatively low exercise intensity, the energy needs are relatively modest. However, preventing hunger and keeping warm are two major concerns for this birdwatcher and will help him/her to enjoy a long day in the outdoors. 


### Solution: 

Pack hot liquids to keep warm and foods high in protein and fiber to provide good satiety.

### Menu Example for a day of nature observation (9am-4pm):


<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
	<tr>
		<th width="30%">Timing</th>
		<th width="40%">Foods</th>
		<th width="30%">Liquids</th>

		<td rowspan="3" style="vertical-align:middle" >Sip on a large thermos of hot tea (1 L or 32 oz).</td>
	</tr>

A consistent breakfast and a satisfying dinner at home are definitely be needed to complete this menu. Extra snacks on the trail might also be needed.

The birdwatcher prefers to describe his/her day by the number of birds or animals observed rather than the km covered. The breaks are frequent (this is how you spot birds right?), so are the opportunities to eat. The exercise intensity is usually low to moderate and given the relatively easy pace, extra weight in the backpack is not a major issue.

### Nutrition Concern:

Given the relatively low exercise intensity, the energy needs are relatively modest. However, making sure this bird watcher keeps warm and is not hungry will help him/her to enjoy a long day in the outdoors. 


### Solution: 

Pack hot liquids to keep warm and foods high in protein and fiber to provide good satiety.

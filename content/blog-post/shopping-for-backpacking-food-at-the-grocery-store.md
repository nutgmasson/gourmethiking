excerpt = "When I moved from the East coast of Canada (Qu√©bec) to the West Coast of USA, I discovered a world of opportunities in terms of hiking, backpacking, rock climbing and backcountry skiing! As a registered dietitian, I was excited to get into food planning for my trips, but when I looked online for resources, it was hard to find recipes I liked and made with easy-to-find ingredients."

No time to shop online for specialized freeze-dried or dehydrated foods? Your regular grocery store has a lot more to offer for backpacking foods than you might think!
 
## Be creative

A lot of the foods in grocery stores can be used for backpacking trips. Here are some examples:

## Protein options can be challenging

Since most protein sources are either refrigerated, frozen or in can, finding lightweight and shelf-stable protein options can be tricky. To add to the complexity, some shelf-stable options involves long preparation time such as dried beans. With some ingenuity, there are ways to get a variety of protein options at low cost:

- Individually sealed cheese and meat sticks
- Dry lentils (cook faster than other dry beans)
- Cooked fish or meat in vacuum-sealed pouches (i.e. salmon, tuna, chicken, ham)
- Milk powder
- Beef and other types of jerkys
- Shelf-stable smoked salmon
 
## Pay attention to the weight and volume of packages
A lot of shelf stable foods are in cans. This means, carrying the can (and its weight) in and out the trail. Look for plastic packages or other lightweight packages. In the case of dry foods, you can also transfer the food in Ziploc-type plastic bags to save on the volume and weight of packages. For example, you can transfer the content of your favorite mac&cheese box in a plastic bag to save on space.

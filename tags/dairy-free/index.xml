      <description>This stew is inspired by chili sin carne recipes. The black bean pasta replace beautifully beans and provide a great deal of protein and fiber to this meal. Try adding Pepper Jack Moon Cheese when serving for an extra crunchy touch and some more protein. If the long spices list is a concern for you, you can always consider using pre-mixed chili spices.
Ingredients  1 ½ cup (375 ml) black bean pasta (I used Black Bean Rotini by Trader Joe’s) ¾ cup (175 ml) freeze-dried corn ½ cup (125 ml) dehydrated tomatoes ⅓ cup (80 ml) dehydrated carrots 4 tsp (20 ml) chicken broth powder* 1 tbsp (15 ml) chili powder 1 tsp (5 ml) paprika 2 tsp (10 ml) onion powder ½ tsp (2 ml) garlic powder ½ tsp (2 ml) coriander seeds, grounded ½ tsp (2 ml) cumin, grounded 2 tbsp (30 ml) tomato paste** 2 6-inch (15 cm) tortillas   *Want to make it vegan?</description>

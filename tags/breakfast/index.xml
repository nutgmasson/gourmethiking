      <description>Are your breakfasts always the same and boring? Not anymore with this recipe of chocolate granola. Hey yes, a recipe with chocolate created by a dietitian for breakfast! And in extra, this granola is fortified in protein for long lasting satiety.
Each portion of 3&amp;frasl;4 cup contains 9g of protein and is low in fat. Add Greek yogurt or cottage cheese and fruits (I chose frozen raspberry and cherries for this picture) to this granola to make a complete meal.</description>

      <description>If you have a garden that produces an impressive quantity of zucchinis and that you don’t know what to do with them at this point, this recipe is for you!
As usual, I tested this recipe in the outdoor. Since it makes a dozen, I brought them on several adventures: from rock climbing to hiking on different trails in Washington State.
Sweet and satisfying these muffins make a good snack.</description>

      <description>Sweet and satisfying, these cookies will be the perfect partners for your next hiking or long bike ride. Rich in carbohydrate, they will provide the fuel you need for your next outdoor adventure. Their protein and fiber content will make you fill full until your next stop.
Vincent and I tested these cookies on a climb of Mt. St. Helens, WA. The cookies were even better on the mountain than in my kitchen!</description>

      <description>If you have a garden that produces an impressive quantity of zucchinis and that you don’t know what to do with them at this point, this recipe is for you!
As usual, I tested this recipe in the outdoor. Since it makes a dozen, I brought them on several adventures: from rock climbing to hiking on different trails in Washington State.
Sweet and satisfying these muffins make a good snack.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I moved from the East coast of Canada (Qu√©bec) to the West Coast of USA, I discovered a world of opportunities in terms of hiking, backpacking, rock climbing and backcountry skiing! As a registered dietitian, I was excited to get into food planning for my trips, but when I looked online for resources, it was hard to find recipes I liked and made with easy-to-find ingredients. It is on a backpacking trip in Grand Teton National Park that I had idea of Gourmet Hiking. Almost 2 years later and after a lot of trial and errors, this is it: Gourmet Hiking is online!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gourmethiking.com/img/posts/website-launch/logo.jpg&#34; class=&#34;recipe-right&#34; /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I am a registered dietitian specialized in sports nutrition and eating disorders with work experience both in research and on-the-field settings, which led me to choose these 2 core principles for Gourmet Hiking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science to trail as a basis for everything:&lt;/em&gt; Nutrition science has so much to offer to outdoor enthusiasts in terms of physical performance, health and enjoyment improvement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taste as the main criteria for recipe creation:&lt;/em&gt; I believe eating need to be enjoyable and satisfying!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

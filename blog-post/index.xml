      <description>You’re about to take a friend on their first backpacking trip. After planning the route and finding gear this friend can borrow, you thought the preparation was almost over… until you realize that your friend cannot eat gluten!

If ramen is your base ingredient when eating on the trail, some changes will be needed to adapt to a gluten-free diet, but luckily for you, many gluten-free options are easy to prepare in the backcountry.</description>

      <title>Boring Oatmeal? Never with these ideas!</title>
      <link>//gourmethiking.com/blog-post/oatmeal-breakfast/</link>

If the idea of eating oatmeal for breakfast while backpacking seems boring, this blog post is for you. Many people&amp;rsquo;s experience of eating oatmeal is limited to sugary packages of instant oatmeal. These commercial products, although very convenient, tend to be high in added sugars and low in protein and although they do contain some fiber, hunger is waiting for you at the next corner.</description>

This recipe for homemade energetic pills contains everything a hiker can hope in capsules. It also reduces the weight of carrying food, fuel and cooking equipment.
Convenience but Taste First Convenience is definitely a plus in this homemade energetic all-in-one pill recipe. Some might ask &amp;ldquo;what about taste?</description>

      <description>Chocolate is for many a treat and for others an essential part of their diet. On the trail, it is definitely a food that brings people together. It can also bring motivation or courage: I remember a guide feeding us chocolate before crossing a glacier fed river or when hours of hiking under cold rain was still needed. When it comes to its nutritional value cocoa contains epicatechin, an antioxidant, for which preliminary research suggests benefits for exercise performance.</description>

      <description>Yeap, a bear played with my food. Here is what happened. Last weekend, I went on an overnight backpacking trip with my husband and friends in the North Cascades, WA, USA (Goat Lake trail for locals). Before settling in our tents for the night, we stored our food in a bear canister and left it close to where we cooked and far from our tents. A bear found the bear canister (can’t blame him, Gourmet Hiking food is delicious!</description>

4 reasons why you should pay attention to proteins Proteins are not just for weightlifters Muscles adapt to the training you are doing. When you accumulate the miles, your body wants to increase its capacity to produce energy from nutrients and oxygen so that hiking at a given pace becomes easier.</description>

      <title>Menu for the Hut Visitor</title>
      <link>//gourmethiking.com/blog-post/hut-visitor-menu/</link>

      <guid>//gourmethiking.com/blog-post/hut-visitor-menu/</guid>
      <description>Whether the hut visitor is on skis or snowboard, he enjoyed planning his day in the outdoors based on the warm hut locations. Stopping for lunch at one hut is a must-do and part of the fun of the day. Exercise intensity to get to the shelter and back can vary significantly based on the terrain and who hut visitor companions are.
Nutrition Concern #1: Since getting to the shelter is the goal of this day trip, the hut visitor can decide to delay food or liquid intake until reaching this hut, which can lead to decreased levels of energy and dehydration.</description>

Maple syrup can be use in much more recipes than only pancakes. High in simple sugars, it is a quick source of energy for all your outdoor adventures. Since March is the prime season for maple syrup production, I thought I would share my favorite ways to enjoy maple syrup on the trail.

      <description>The young explorers are happy (or sometimes not that happy) to follow their parents in the outdoors. Depending on the personality and the energy level of the young explorer, the moving pace can be pretty high or painfully slow. But what should we feed these young explorers?
Nutrition Concern #1: Young explorers can be very attuned to his/her hunger cues or too excited to be in the outdoors and forget about eating.</description>

      <description>This year for Valentine’s Day, why not doing something different? Your partner or spouse prefers the quietness of nature to the crowded environment of restaurants? And thinks there is nothing like spending time together hiking, snowshoeing or skiing? Instead of going to a restaurant with your lover (and some many other couples!), why not packing lovely food and enjoy it in the outdoors?

      <title>Menu for the Birdwatcher</title>
      <link>//gourmethiking.com/blog-post/birdwatcher-menu/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2018 20:39:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//gourmethiking.com/blog-post/birdwatcher-menu/</guid>
      <description>The birdwatcher prefers to describe his/her day by the number of birds or animals observed rather than the km covered. The breaks are frequent (this is how you spot birds right?), so are the opportunities to eat. The exercise intensity is usually low to moderate and given the relatively easy pace, extra weight in the backpack is not a major issue.
Nutrition Concern: Given the relatively low exercise intensity, the energy needs are relatively modest.</description>

      <title>Menu for the Intense Backcountry Skier</title>
      <link>//gourmethiking.com/blog-post/backcountry-ski-menu/</link>

      <guid>//gourmethiking.com/blog-post/backcountry-ski-menu/</guid>
      <description>The intense backcountry skier skins up as quickly as possible in the early morning to have fresh tracks and repeats this as often as possible well into the afternoon (or until the avalanche risk becomes too high). Usually, he exercises at high intensity, which increases the energy (calorie) needs and water loss through sweating and heavy breathing. On the other hand, breaks are short, if existent, and space in day pack limited since it is almost full of all the avalanche gear.</description>

      <guid>//gourmethiking.com/blog-post/pasta-ideas/</guid>
      <description>Pasta and other wheat products have a kind of a bad reputation these days. This is too bad because pasta is rich in carbohydrates, the preferred energy source of muscles while hiking and performing other physical activity tasks. Pasta made with wheat also contain several B vitamins. For a high fiber content, go for the whole wheat or whole grain pasta.
Versatile, pasta is an easy go-to option for many campers and backpackers.</description>

Day 1 Breakfast:  Cranberry, Orange, Dark Chocolate and Sweet potato muffins Muffins Coffee latte and a piece of fruit to eat in the car while driving to the trailhead  Lunch:  Your favorite turkey and swiss cheese sandwich prepared at home  Dinner:  Smoked salmon Pasta, chocolate covered almonds</description>

      <title>What are your fluid needs at high altitudes?</title>
      <link>//gourmethiking.com/blog-post/altitude-fluid/</link>

      <guid>//gourmethiking.com/blog-post/altitude-fluid/</guid>
      <description>Hiking and backpacking in remote (and awesome) places such as mountains and glaciers often means reaching higher altitudes than where we normally live. The higher we climb the more the effects of altitude will be felt, such as increased perception of effort (it becomes more difficult to perform the same task) and increased ventilation (breathing more heavily). Some effects of altitude are less noticeable, yet just as significant, such as changes in fluid needs.</description>

      <description>Trader Joe’s grocery store, with its unique products, can be a great source of inspiration for new backpacking recipes. Here are some of recent findings:
Freeze dried fruits Freeze dried foods have a lot of advantages compared to dehydrated: -They tend to have a flavor more similar to fresh foods -They contain more nutrients, thanks to the faster transformation process -They rehydrate faster. However, freeze dried foods can be expensive. Not at Trader Joe’s!</description>

      <description>Your need for an espresso fix has nothing to do with how coffee tastes (Ok, the taste can be pretty wonderful!), but rather with the drug that it contains: caffeine. Let’s face it: most of us are caffeine addicts. But how does this drug affect us? Can it provide any benefits to hikers and backpackers?
What is it? Caffeine is a chemical naturally found in plants such as coffee beans, cocoa beans, kola nuts, tea leaves and guarana.</description>

      <description>No time to shop online for specialized freeze-dried or dehydrated foods? Your regular grocery store has a lot more to offer for backpacking foods than you might think!
Be creative A lot of the foods in grocery stores can be used for backpacking trips. Here are some examples:
 Category Examples   Grains Pasta, rice, couscous, rice noodles   Seasonings Dried spices and herbs, small containers of curry paste or tomato pasta, parmesan cheese   Vegetables Sun-dried tomatoes, dehydrated onions or chives (in the spices sections), dehydrated mushrooms   Breakfast Instant oatmeal, wheat cream, granola, breakfast cereals, milk powder    Snacks Bars, dried fruits, nuts, seeds, premixed trail mix    Protein options can be challenging Since most protein sources are either refrigerated, frozen or in can, finding lightweight and shelf-stable protein options can be tricky.</description>

      <description>When I moved from the East coast of Canada (Québec) to the West Coast of USA, I discovered a world of opportunities in terms of hiking, backpacking, rock climbing and backcountry skiing! As a registered dietitian, I was excited to get into food planning for my trips, but when I looked online for resources, it was hard to find recipes I liked and made with easy-to-find ingredients. It is on a backpacking trip in Grand Teton National Park that I had idea of Gourmet Hiking.</description>

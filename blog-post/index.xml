      <description>Your need for an espresso fix has nothing to do with how coffee tastes (Ok, the taste can be pretty wonderful!), but rather with the drug that it contains: caffeine. Let’s face it: most of us are caffeine addicts. But how does this drug affect us? Can it provide any benefits to hikers and backpackers?
What is it? Caffeine is a chemical naturally found in plants such as coffee beans, cocoa beans, kola nuts, tea leaves and guarana.</description>

      <description>No time to shop online for specialized freeze-dried or dehydrated foods? Your regular grocery store has a lot more to offer for backpacking foods than you might think!
Be creative A lot of the foods in grocery stores can be used for backpacking trips. Here are some examples:
 Category Examples   Grains Pasta, rice, couscous, rice noodles   Seasonings Dried spices and herbs, small containers of curry paste or tomato pasta, parmesan cheese   Vegetables Sun-dried tomatoes, dehydrated onions or chives (in the spices sections), dehydrated mushrooms   Breakfast Instant oatmeal, wheat cream, granola, breakfast cereals, milk powder    Snacks Bars, dried fruits, nuts, seeds, premixed trail mix    Protein options can be challenging Since most protein sources are either refrigerated, frozen or in can, finding lightweight and shelf-stable protein options can be tricky.</description>

      <description>When I moved from the East coast of Canada (Québec) to the West Coast of USA, I discovered a world of opportunities in terms of hiking, backpacking, rock climbing and backcountry skiing! As a registered dietitian, I was excited to get into food planning for my trips, but when I looked online for resources, it was hard to find recipes I liked and made with easy-to-find ingredients. It is on a backpacking trip in Grand Teton National Park that I had idea of Gourmet Hiking.</description>

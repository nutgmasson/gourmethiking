      <description>No time to dehydrate all of your food before your next backpacking trip? No need to order online a bunch of different (and expensive) freeze-dried foods! It can be easy to make tasty and nutritious meals from ingredients available at your grocery store. Here is an example:
Day 1 Breakfast:  Cranberry, Orange, Dark Chocolate and Sweet potato muffins Muffins Coffee latte and a piece of fruit to eat in the car while driving to the trailhead  Lunch:  Your favorite turkey and swiss cheese sandwich prepared at home  Dinner:  Smoked salmon Pasta, chocolate covered almonds</description>

      <title>What are your fluid needs at high altitudes?</title>

      <description>Hiking and backpacking in remote (and awesome) places such as mountains and glaciers often means reaching higher altitudes than where we normally live. The higher we climb the more the effects of altitude will be felt, such as increased perception of effort (it becomes more difficult to perform the same task) and increased ventilation (breathing more heavily). Some effects of altitude are less noticeable, yet just as significant, such as changes in fluid needs.</description>

      <description>Trader Joe’s grocery store, with its unique products, can be a great source of inspiration for new backpacking recipes. Here are some of recent findings:
Freeze dried fruits Freeze dried foods have a lot of advantages compared to dehydrated: -They tend to have a flavor more similar to fresh foods -They contain more nutrients, thanks to the faster transformation process -They rehydrate faster. However, freeze dried foods can be expensive. Not at Trader Joe’s!</description>

      <title>Need your espresso fix even on the trail?</title>

      <description>Your need for an espresso fix has nothing to do with how coffee tastes (Ok, the taste can be pretty wonderful!), but rather with the drug that it contains: caffeine. Let’s face it: most of us are caffeine addicts. But how does this drug affect us? Can it provide any benefits to hikers and backpackers?
What is it? Caffeine is a chemical naturally found in plants such as coffee beans, cocoa beans, kola nuts, tea leaves and guarana.</description>

      <title>Shopping for Backpacking Food at the Grocery Store</title>

      <guid>//gourmethiking.com/blog-post/shopping-for-backpacking-food-at-the-grocery-store/</guid>
      <description>No time to shop online for specialized freeze-dried or dehydrated foods? Your regular grocery store has a lot more to offer for backpacking foods than you might think!
Be creative A lot of the foods in grocery stores can be used for backpacking trips. Here are some examples:
 Category Examples   Grains Pasta, rice, couscous, rice noodles   Seasonings Dried spices and herbs, small containers of curry paste or tomato pasta, parmesan cheese   Vegetables Sun-dried tomatoes, dehydrated onions or chives (in the spices sections), dehydrated mushrooms   Breakfast Instant oatmeal, wheat cream, granola, breakfast cereals, milk powder    Snacks Bars, dried fruits, nuts, seeds, premixed trail mix    Protein options can be challenging Since most protein sources are either refrigerated, frozen or in can, finding lightweight and shelf-stable protein options can be tricky.</description>

      <description>When I moved from the East coast of Canada (Québec) to the West Coast of USA, I discovered a world of opportunities in terms of hiking, backpacking, rock climbing and backcountry skiing! As a registered dietitian, I was excited to get into food planning for my trips, but when I looked online for resources, it was hard to find recipes I liked and made with easy-to-find ingredients. It is on a backpacking trip in Grand Teton National Park that I had idea of Gourmet Hiking.</description>

      <title>Need your espresso fix even on the trail?</title>
      <link>http://gourmethiking.com/blog-post/caffeine/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Your need for an espresso fix has nothing to do with how coffee tastes (Ok, the taste can be pretty wonderful!), but rather with the drug that it contains: caffeine. Let’s face it: most of us are caffeine addicts. But how does this drug affect us? Can it provide any benefits to hikers and backpackers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gourmethiking.com/img/posts/caffeine/coffee.jpg&#34; class=&#34;recipe-right&#34; /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-it&#34;&gt;What is it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is a chemical naturally found in plants such as coffee beans, cocoa beans, kola nuts, tea leaves and guarana.  It can also be extracted from these plants. Because caffeine is water and lipids (fat) soluble, it can easily be added to many foods.  This is how the food industry can create caffeinated sports gels, gummies, chewing gum, energy drinks and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-it-work&#34;&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long period of time, scientists thought the main performance enhancing mechanism of caffeine was associated with glycogen sparing, which means that caffeine would allow the body to rely more on fat and less on carbohydrates for energy. This is of particular importance in endurance exercise, such as hiking or backpacking. However, (relatively) new evidence shows that this mechanism does not occur in the same way for everybody. Along with new studies suggesting performance enhancing effects in short  duration exercise and with low doses of caffeine, it became clear that the sparing of glycogen is not the main mechanism explaining the effects of caffeine on performance.  New reliable  evidence suggests a mechanism that implies the central nervous system (brain). It is now suggested that caffeine acts on the central nervous system by maintaining our will to keep exercising (central drive), reducing the perceived pain and fatigue sensations and sustaining  our muscles’ ability to contract and produce force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;in-brief-caffeine-blocks-our-perception-of-fatigue-and-pain-and-allows-us-to-pursue-the-exercise-in-spite-of-fatigue-or-pain&#34;&gt;In brief, &lt;em&gt;caffeine blocks our perception of fatigue and pain and allows us to pursue the exercise in spite of fatigue or pain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;if-this-seems-too-good-to-be-true-then-it-probably-is&#34;&gt;If this seems too good to be true, then it probably is!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caffeine consumed in excess causes side effects, such as: increased anxiety and heart rate, jitters, the inability to focus, insomnia and irritability. Every person reacts differently to caffeine intakes with some people experiencing more severe side effects than others. A moderate intake (about 2-3 cups of coffee/day) or less minimizes the symptoms in most people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;does-it-cause-dehydration&#34;&gt;Does it cause dehydration?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, it was purported  that caffeine had a considerable diuretic effect.  However, a recent meta-analysis  (a compiled analysis of  the results of several individual studies), suggests a different conclusion. The diuretic effect of caffeine appears to be minor, regardless of the quantity of caffeine ingested. At any rate, the effect would impact women more than men. It should be noted that the slight diuretic effect of caffeine seems to fade during exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;the-bottom-line-is-moderate-caffeine-intake-is-not-a-major-cause-of-dehydration&#34;&gt;The bottom line is: &lt;em&gt;moderate caffeine intake is not a major cause of dehydration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps you become a more informed caffeine addict! ;) Feel free to enjoy your coffee or tea on the trail! (In moderation, of course!)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shopping for Backpacking Food at the Grocery Store</title>

&lt;p&gt;No time to shop online for specialized freeze-dried or dehydrated foods? Your regular grocery store has a lot more to offer for backpacking foods than you might think!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;be-creative&#34;&gt;Be creative&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the foods in grocery stores can be used for backpacking trips. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class=&#34;table table-striped table-bordered&#34;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Examples&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Grains&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Pasta, rice, couscous, rice noodles&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Seasonings&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Dried spices and herbs, small containers of curry paste or tomato pasta, parmesan cheese&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Vegetables&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Sun-dried tomatoes, dehydrated onions or chives (in the spices sections), dehydrated mushrooms&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Breakfast&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Instant oatmeal, wheat cream, granola, breakfast cereals, milk powder
&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Snacks&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Bars, dried fruits, nuts, seeds, premixed trail mix
&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gourmethiking.com/img/posts/grocery_shopping/thumbnail.jpg&#34; class=&#34;recipe-right&#34; /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;protein-options-can-be-challenging&#34;&gt;Protein options can be challenging&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since most protein sources are either refrigerated, frozen or in can, finding lightweight and shelf-stable protein options can be tricky. To add to the complexity, some shelf-stable options involves long preparation time such as dried beans. With some ingenuity, there are ways to get a variety of protein options at low cost:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individually sealed cheese and meat sticks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dry lentils (cook faster than other dry beans)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cooked fish or meat in vacuum-sealed pouches (i.e. salmon, tuna, chicken, ham)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Milk powder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beef and other types of jerkys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shelf-stable smoked salmon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pay-attention-to-the-weight-and-volume-of-packages&#34;&gt;Pay attention to the weight and volume of packages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of shelf stable foods are in cans. This means, carrying the can (and its weight) in and out the trail. Look for plastic packages or other lightweight packages. In the case of dry foods, you can also transfer the food in Ziploc-type plastic bags to save on the volume and weight of packages. For example, you can transfer the content of your favorite mac&amp;amp;cheese box in a plastic bag to save on space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more ideas of backpacking foods in grocery stores near you. I will share my findings I make in different grocery stores from the Pacific Northwest on &lt;a href=&#34;http://gourmethiking.com/product-reviews/&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A New Valuable Resource for Outdoor Enthusiasts!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I moved from the East coast of Canada (Québec) to the West Coast of USA, I discovered a world of opportunities in terms of hiking, backpacking, rock climbing and backcountry skiing! As a registered dietitian, I was excited to get into food planning for my trips, but when I looked online for resources, it was hard to find recipes I liked and made with easy-to-find ingredients. It is on a backpacking trip in Grand Teton National Park that I had idea of Gourmet Hiking. Almost 2 years later and after a lot of trial and errors, this is it: Gourmet Hiking is online!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gourmethiking.com/img/posts/website-launch/logo.jpg&#34; class=&#34;recipe-right&#34; /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I am a registered dietitian specialized in sports nutrition and eating disorders with work experience both in research and on-the-field settings, which led me to choose these 2 core principles for Gourmet Hiking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science to trail as a basis for everything:&lt;/em&gt; Nutrition science has so much to offer to outdoor enthusiasts in terms of physical performance, health and enjoyment improvement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taste as the main criteria for recipe creation:&lt;/em&gt; I believe eating need to be enjoyable and satisfying!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

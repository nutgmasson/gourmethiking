      <title>Orange and Chocolate Protein Balls</title>

      <description>Some Canadian friends told me these protein balls remind them of the famous Tim Hortons’ Timbits. Although these protein balls have similar taste and shape than the Timbits, their nutritional value is way more interesting with 4.7g of fiber and 9.3 g of protein per serving (2 balls).
Ingredients  ¾ cup (175 ml) chopped dates ½ cup (125 ml) orange juice 2 tsp (10 ml) fresh orange zest 3 tbsp (45 ml) cocoa 1 cup (250 ml) quick oats ¾ cup (175 ml) whey protein isolate ⅓ cup (80 ml) coconut flour, divided   Preparation  Bring dates and orange juice to boil and let simmer for 10 minutes.</description>

      <title>Need your espresso fix even on the trail?</title>
      <link>http://gourmethiking.com/blog-post/caffeine/</link>

      <guid>http://gourmethiking.com/blog-post/caffeine/</guid>
      <description>Your need for an espresso fix has nothing to do with how coffee tastes (Ok, the taste can be pretty wonderful!), but rather with the drug that it contains: caffeine. Let’s face it: most of us are caffeine addicts. But how does this drug affect us? Can it provide any benefits to hikers and backpackers?
What is it? Caffeine is a chemical naturally found in plants such as coffee beans, cocoa beans, kola nuts, tea leaves and guarana.</description>

      <description>Taste 3 / 5 Subtle notes of lime for the first bite but for the following bites, it seems like the spicyness is the only thing noticeable. Texture is ok.

      <title>Shopping for Backpacking Food at the Grocery Store</title>

      <description>No time to shop online for specialized freeze-dried or dehydrated foods? Your regular grocery store has a lot more to offer for backpacking foods than you might think!
Be creative A lot of the foods in grocery stores can be used for backpacking trips. Here are some examples:
 Category Examples   Grains Pasta, rice, couscous, rice noodles   Seasonings Dried spices and herbs, small containers of curry paste or tomato pasta, parmesan cheese   Vegetables Sun-dried tomatoes, dehydrated onions or chives (in the spices sections), dehydrated mushrooms   Breakfast Instant oatmeal, wheat cream, granola, breakfast cereals, milk powder    Snacks Bars, dried fruits, nuts, seeds, premixed trail mix    Protein options can be challenging Since most protein sources are either refrigerated, frozen or in can, finding lightweight and shelf-stable protein options can be tricky.</description>

      <description>Taste 5 / 5 Tomato pasta in purée. No added herbs or seasoning. It is very versatile and can be used in a lot of recipes on the trail: pasta sauce, mexican rice, chili, stews and soups.
Nutrition analysis 4.5 / 5 Pros: Low in sodium (25mg/ pouch) and high in potassium (420 mg/pouch). It looks like there is no added sugar (according to the ingredient list). High fiber content (3g/pouch).</description>

      <description>When I moved from the East coast of Canada (Québec) to the West Coast of USA, I discovered a world of opportunities in terms of hiking, backpacking, rock climbing and backcountry skiing! As a registered dietitian, I was excited to get into food planning for my trips, but when I looked online for resources, it was hard to find recipes I liked and made with easy-to-find ingredients. It is on a backpacking trip in Grand Teton National Park that I had idea of Gourmet Hiking.</description>

      <title>Oatmega Mint Crisp</title>
      <link>http://gourmethiking.com/product-reviews/oatmega-mint-crisp/</link>

      <guid>http://gourmethiking.com/product-reviews/oatmega-mint-crisp/</guid>
      <description>Taste 4.5 / 5 Nice texture that stays soft even at freezing temperature. Good taste of chocolate and mint. Hardly noticeable taste of whey
Nutrition analysis 4 / 5 Pros: High content of fiber (7g/bar), low simple sugars (5g/bar) and high content in protein (14g/bar) which helps with satiety. It makes it a good snack for low to moderate intensity activities. Whey comes from grass-fed cows and fish oil from responsibly-caught fish.</description>

      <title>Oberto’s Applewood Smoked Bacon Jerky</title>
      <link>http://gourmethiking.com/product-reviews/oberto-applewood-smoked-bacon-jerky/</link>

      <guid>http://gourmethiking.com/product-reviews/oberto-applewood-smoked-bacon-jerky/</guid>
      <description>Taste 4.5 / 5 Authentic taste of bacon with a nice applewood smoke twist to it. Although the jerky is pretty dry, it is not too tough to eat. This jerky is good to eat on its own but could also be a good addition to dishes cooked on the trail such as egg scrambles or alfredo pasta.
Nutrition analysis 2.5 / 5 Pros: High in protein (12g/oz) for a jerky.</description>

      <guid>http://gourmethiking.com/product-reviews/tillamook-teriyaki-meat-stick/</guid>
      <description>Taste 2.5 / 5 Nothing exceptional here. The taste reminded me of hot-dogs… Inside texture is soft, the outside layer being a little rough.
Nutrition analysis 2 / 5 Pros: not much to say here… The first ingredients are beef and pork!
Cons: Long list of ingredients that required advanced nutrition knowledge to understand. High in sodium (533mg/oz). High in fat (8g/oz) and relatively high in saturated fat (3g/oz). Relatively low in protein (5g/oz) for meat-based product.</description>

      <guid>http://gourmethiking.com/product-reviews/smoked-dried-beef-steak-cuts-teriyaki/</guid>
      <description>Taste 3.5 / 5 The thick pieces change from the usual thin sliced jerky. Texture is soft. Taste does not offer anything out of the ordinary: sweet soy sauce&amp;hellip;
Nutrition analysis 4 / 5 Pros: Ingredients’ list is short and very easy to understand. More protein than carbohydrates, which is what we are looking for in a jerky!
Cons: Sodium (450 mg/oz) is pretty high.</description>

      <guid>http://gourmethiking.com/recipes/broccoli-salmon-mac-n-cheese/</guid>
      <description>Forget the Mac&amp;amp;Cheese mix in a box. This recipe is rich and provides a generous amount of vegetables (quite rare in backpacking!). The high content in protein (48g/serving) will provide a long lasting satiety sensation. The high carbohydrate content will replenish your muscle glycogen and will prepare you for more adventures on the following day. The relatively short list of ingredients makes it easy to prepare at home and on the trail.</description>

      <title>Tons of ideas to pimp your pasta meals on the trail</title>
      <link>//gourmethiking.com/blog-post/pasta-ideas/</link>

      <guid>//gourmethiking.com/blog-post/pasta-ideas/</guid>
      <description>Pasta and other wheat products have a kind of a bad reputation these days. This is too bad because pasta is rich in carbohydrates, the preferred energy source of muscles while hiking and performing other physical activity tasks. Pasta made with wheat also contain several B vitamins. For a high fiber content, go for the whole wheat or whole grain pasta.
Versatile, pasta is an easy go-to option for many campers and backpackers.</description>

      <title>What are your fluid needs at high altitudes?</title>
      <link>//gourmethiking.com/blog-post/altitude-fluid/</link>

      <guid>//gourmethiking.com/blog-post/altitude-fluid/</guid>
      <description>Hiking and backpacking in remote (and awesome) places such as mountains and glaciers often means reaching higher altitudes than where we normally live. The higher we climb the more the effects of altitude will be felt, such as increased perception of effort (it becomes more difficult to perform the same task) and increased ventilation (breathing more heavily). Some effects of altitude are less noticeable, yet just as significant, such as changes in fluid needs.</description>

      <description>These energy balls have a subtil coffee taste that will please the coffee lovers but are sweet enough to please the non coffee drinkers.

      <description>Trader Joe’s grocery store, with its unique products, can be a great source of inspiration for new backpacking recipes. Here are some of recent findings:
Freeze dried fruits Freeze dried foods have a lot of advantages compared to dehydrated: -They tend to have a flavor more similar to fresh foods -They contain more nutrients, thanks to the faster transformation process -They rehydrate faster. However, freeze dried foods can be expensive. Not at Trader Joe’s!</description>

      <guid>//gourmethiking.com/recipes/chili-stew/</guid>
      <description>This stew is inspired by chili sin carne recipes. The black bean pasta replace beautifully beans and provide a great deal of protein and fiber to this meal. Try adding Pepper Jack Moon Cheese when serving for an extra crunchy touch and some more protein. If the long spices list is a concern for you, you can always consider using pre-mixed chili spices.
Ingredients  1 ½ cup (375 ml) black bean pasta (I used Black Bean Rotini by Trader Joe’s) ¾ cup (175 ml) freeze-dried corn ½ cup (125 ml) dehydrated tomatoes ⅓ cup (80 ml) dehydrated carrots 4 tsp (20 ml) chicken broth powder* 1 tbsp (15 ml) chili powder 1 tsp (5 ml) paprika 2 tsp (10 ml) onion powder ½ tsp (2 ml) garlic powder ½ tsp (2 ml) coriander seeds, grounded ½ tsp (2 ml) cumin, grounded 2 tbsp (30 ml) tomato paste** 2 6-inch (15 cm) tortillas  *Want to make it vegan?</description>

      <description>Some Canadian friends told me these protein balls remind them of the famous Tim Hortons’ Timbits. Although these protein balls have similar taste and shape than the Timbits, their nutritional value is way more interesting with 4.7g of fiber and 9.3 g of protein per serving (2 balls).
Ingredients  ¾ cup (175 ml) chopped dates ½ cup (125 ml) orange juice 2 tsp (10 ml) fresh orange zest 3 tbsp (45 ml) cocoa 1 cup (250 ml) quick oats ¾ cup (175 ml) whey protein isolate ⅓ cup (80 ml) coconut flour, divided  Preparation  Bring dates and orange juice to boil and let simmer for 10 minutes.</description>

      <description>Your need for an espresso fix has nothing to do with how coffee tastes (Ok, the taste can be pretty wonderful!), but rather with the drug that it contains: caffeine. Let’s face it: most of us are caffeine addicts. But how does this drug affect us? Can it provide any benefits to hikers and backpackers?
What is it? Caffeine is a chemical naturally found in plants such as coffee beans, cocoa beans, kola nuts, tea leaves and guarana.</description>

      <description>Taste 3 / 5 Subtle notes of lime for the first bite but for the following bites, it seems like the spicyness is the only thing noticeable. Texture is ok.
Nutrition analysis 3.5 / 5 Pros: Low in fat (1.5g/oz). Sodium (380mg/oz) is lower than in other jerkys. Ingredient list relatively easy to understand.

      <description>No time to shop online for specialized freeze-dried or dehydrated foods? Your regular grocery store has a lot more to offer for backpacking foods than you might think!
Be creative A lot of the foods in grocery stores can be used for backpacking trips. Here are some examples:
 Category Examples   Grains Pasta, rice, couscous, rice noodles   Seasonings Dried spices and herbs, small containers of curry paste or tomato pasta, parmesan cheese   Vegetables Sun-dried tomatoes, dehydrated onions or chives (in the spices sections), dehydrated mushrooms   Breakfast Instant oatmeal, wheat cream, granola, breakfast cereals, milk powder    Snacks Bars, dried fruits, nuts, seeds, premixed trail mix    Protein options can be challenging Since most protein sources are either refrigerated, frozen or in can, finding lightweight and shelf-stable protein options can be tricky.</description>

Nutrition analysis 4.5 / 5 Pros: Low in sodium (25mg/ pouch) and high in potassium (420 mg/pouch). It looks like there is no added sugar (according to the ingredient list). High fiber content (3g/pouch).</description>

      <description>When I moved from the East coast of Canada (Québec) to the West Coast of USA, I discovered a world of opportunities in terms of hiking, backpacking, rock climbing and backcountry skiing! As a registered dietitian, I was excited to get into food planning for my trips, but when I looked online for resources, it was hard to find recipes I liked and made with easy-to-find ingredients. It is on a backpacking trip in Grand Teton National Park that I had idea of Gourmet Hiking.</description>

      <description>Taste 4.5 / 5 Nice texture that stays soft even at freezing temperature. Good taste of chocolate and mint. Hardly noticeable taste of whey
Nutrition analysis 4 / 5 Pros: High content of fiber (7g/bar), low simple sugars (5g/bar) and high content in protein (14g/bar) which helps with satiety. It makes it a good snack for low to moderate intensity activities. Whey comes from grass-fed cows and fish oil from responsibly-caught fish.</description>

      <guid>//gourmethiking.com/product-reviews/oberto-applewood-smoked-bacon-jerky/</guid>
      <description>Taste 4.5 / 5 Authentic taste of bacon with a nice applewood smoke twist to it. Although the jerky is pretty dry, it is not too tough to eat. This jerky is good to eat on its own but could also be a good addition to dishes cooked on the trail such as egg scrambles or alfredo pasta.
Nutrition analysis 2.5 / 5 Pros: High in protein (12g/oz) for a jerky.</description>

      <guid>//gourmethiking.com/product-reviews/tillamook-teriyaki-meat-stick/</guid>
      <description>Taste 2.5 / 5 Nothing exceptional here. The taste reminded me of hot-dogs… Inside texture is soft, the outside layer being a little rough.
Nutrition analysis 2 / 5 Pros: not much to say here… The first ingredients are beef and pork!
Cons: Long list of ingredients that required advanced nutrition knowledge to understand. High in sodium (533mg/oz). High in fat (8g/oz) and relatively high in saturated fat (3g/oz). Relatively low in protein (5g/oz) for meat-based product.</description>

      <description>Taste 3.5 / 5 The thick pieces change from the usual thin sliced jerky. Texture is soft. Taste does not offer anything out of the ordinary: sweet soy sauce&amp;hellip;
Nutrition analysis 4 / 5 Pros: Ingredients’ list is short and very easy to understand. More protein than carbohydrates, which is what we are looking for in a jerky!
Cons: Sodium (450 mg/oz) is pretty high.</description>

      <description>Forget the Mac&amp;amp;Cheese mix in a box. This recipe is rich and provides a generous amount of vegetables (quite rare in backpacking!). The high content in protein (48g/serving) will provide a long lasting satiety sensation. The high carbohydrate content will replenish your muscle glycogen and will prepare you for more adventures on the following day. The relatively short list of ingredients makes it easy to prepare at home and on the trail.</description>
